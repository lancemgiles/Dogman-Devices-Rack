Chorus DSP:

This is basically just three parellel delays,
each with a phase-shifted LFO

the delay is feed input and feedback
the delay's dry signal is the input, and the previous sample * feedback
the pitch of the delay is just the time, some goofy math gets This
The clock frqeuncey translates this pitch into a frequency (delay time)
    all of this is so the time control can used like an pitched oscillator

get the numder of deisered delay samples
this is the sample rate / frequency and is relative to the size of the history buffer

new samples get pushed into the history buffer

not really sure what the outbuffer does but this basically the wet channel

wet is clamped to range
the lastwet is updated

the wet and input are crossfaded at the user's mix setting

global varialble tracking the delay output is updated


in the process function,
delay function is called and the corresponding output is updated
